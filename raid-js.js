This is repeated throughout the entire fight. Healers have to maximise their healing efficiency in those 3 seconds to top both the tanks and the raid. Deathbloom is a dot placed on a random player that deals minimal dot damage and blooms after 6 seconds dealing more damage. Spores spawn throughout the fight with almost no damage and 3,000 health, upon death they grant the 5 nearest players a 50% crit chance buff and a 100% threat reduction. These should be rotated through strongest dps players. Under no circumstances let a tank get this, the threat reduction will really cause issues. Inevitable Doom is the Dps race mechanic, after 2 minutes Loatheb will being casting Inevitable doom dealing 4000 (5000 on 25 man) damage, this starts slow and becomes increasingly faster, after 7 minutes this will be cast every 15 seconds and is seen as the hard enrage.",

A taunt (5 on the hotbar) - taunts the boss A Bone Shield (6 on the hotbar) - this reduces damage taken by strikes for 20 seconds. People controlling the understudies should reset their timers after the other taunts to maintain a healthy timer at all times, bone shield then taunt to minimise damage and swap as bone shield is running out. Dps shouldn't kill the understudies till after the fight and should focus strictly on the boss. The boss does have a few mechanics also, Unbalancing strike dealing around 100k damage before mitigation and lowers defence by 100 for 6 seconds. Jagged knife thrown randomly dealing damage and applying a bleed, this is quite painful so prio healing here. Disrupting shout deals damage (more on 25) to everyone in the group, Should be easily raid healable. ** On 25 man you need two priests with mind control to do the understudies as the pylons aren’t there **",

This is the safest tactic. The second tactic involves having everyone stay on the alive side, between 2 and 2:30 minutes in to the fight the gate will open and all of the undead mobs will rush through, have traps / totems setup to slow the flow of adds and AOE nuke them down, melee avoid going in here as they do an arcane explosion that will likely kill you. In phase 2, Gothik teleports down into the alive side and begins a minor dps race, the boss puts a debuff on every member reducing their stats by 10% which stacks up to 9 times. Killing this before it stacks too high is quite important. The boss also casts shadow bolts on the tank and teleports between sides every 15 seconds.",

Sir Zeliek, a paladin in life, so strong in his faith, that even in undeath, the power of the light still heeds his call, smiting his foes in battle. The final death knight, Lord Mograine, was the finest warrior that the death knights had ever seen. However, after the events of Azeroth, he vanished without a trace. Kel'Thuzad has appointed Baron Rivendare in his place.",
                    "overview": "A complex fight, as you enter the room there will be 4 bosses in the centre of the room, upon engaging these they will run to specific corners of the room. Thane Korth’azz - Entrance side left, Baron Rivendare - Entrance side right, Lady Blaumeux - Far Left, Sir Zeliek - Far Right. The core mechanic of this fight is the “Mark of” system, each boss will apply a mark to all players within 45 yards. This does increasing damage with 4 marks being high damage, and 5 marks likely to be an instant death. The idea is you split into small groups and attack different bosses, as your marks stack up you switch to another boss, attaining their mark and resetting the old bosses. Things to know about the bosses, Thane / Baron have threat tables and must be tanked, they are also the only two that will move once they have reached their corners. Zeliek and Blaumeux stay in their corners and will continuously attack the closest target. **Note - something heavily used on non-official servers includes having a paladin divine intervention someone in between the two bosses corners at the back before pulling. This allows that person to freely immune the damage taken by both bosses due to their “target closest” mechanic, it may not work on retail**. The common tactic in this fight involves having a tank and a healer go to the back of the room and split up, one being close to Zeliek and one close to Blaumeux, they don't hit very hard and you can swap at 3 stacks to minimise mark damage. The remaining players stack Baron + Thane up and nuke, As long as they die before the 5th stack, you should be fine. This is the typical Bloodlust point. After this split evenly between the two remaining bosses and kill them, swapping on 3 or 4 marks. Careful with Blaumeux as she casts a Void Zone that deals high damage to players in it. Zeliek casts holy wrath, a holy chain lightning effect that increases with each jump. Be sure to spread. If Blaumeux and Zeliek have noone in 45 yards they will cast pulsing AoE room wide dps that will quickly wipe the raid.",

Mutating Injection, this is the mechanic that will wipe groups, a debuff will be applied to players that after 10 seconds (or upon dispel, more on this later) the player and all those nearby will take large nature damage and spawn an expanding poison cloud. These Mutating Injections should be taken to a wall behind the tank that is kiting the boss (as to not spawn clouds in the kite path), they can either be dispelled or wait the full duration, the Mutating Injections start at roughly 20 sec intervals and become quicker that longer the fight. Never use disease cleansing totem on this boss, you will wipe the raid, the totem will instantly cleanse these and clouds will be everywhere. The boss does a frontal cleave called Slime Spray that deals moderate nature damage and spawns a Fallout Slime for every person (pets not included) hit. Fallout Slimes pulse AOE nature damage to all players in 10 yards and should be cleaved down quickly. Finally the boss has a 12 minute enrage, that will likely lead to an instant wipe of the raid.",

                    "overview": "Gluth is an interesting boss with two tactics and minimal mechanics. The fight typically starts by jumping out of a pipe into the boss room, immediately grabbing agro on the boss. This can be cheesed with fight resets like feign death or vanish to allow your group to get down and positioned correctly. This is heavily recommended. Gluth spawns zombies throughout the fight, and if they make it to Gluth he will eat them for 5% of his health. He also stacks a mortal strike type mechanic on the MT, this cannot be bubbled off or reset by other means other than expiry, Two tanks (or a very tanky plate wearer) should taunt the boss to allow stacks to reset. Gluth has an actual enrage mechanic as well, periodically increasing his attack speed by 25% (100% in 25 man) for 8 seconds, rogues and hunters can remove this with tranq shot and anaesthetic poison. After 105 seconds Gluth will Decimate everything in the room, reducing both players and zombies health to 5% and forcing the zombies to run directly to Gluth, quickly healing up after this and killing zombies is a priority. This continues until 4 decimates of which the boss hard enrages and will likely wipe the raid very quickly. The zombies spawn regularly throughout the fight and apply a stack of infected wound on a player increasing physical damage done by a small amount,  this stacks up and will allow zombies to overwhelm people quickly. There are two tactics to kill Gluth, One - Burst the boss, ignore the adds entirely, just nuke the boss, you will want a player with a mortal strike effect (wound poison, mortal strike etc) to maintain 100% uptime on that debuff to reduce the healing Gluth receives. You need to be able to do a considerable amount of raid dps to do this tactic. Two - The second tactic involves having someone pickup the adds and kite them, using things like blizzard, frost / freezing traps, holy wrath stuns, earthbind totems etc to avoid the zombies ever hitting the player kiting, whilst having the boss tanked against the door at the far end of the room. After Decimate you want to have the raid switch to the zombies and kill them asap as they will run directly to Gluth.",

                    "overview": "A two phase fight, firstly a fight involving two constructs that are on separate platforms. Split the group evenly as they must die within a very short period of each other. A tank and healers are needed on either side. These are quite healing intensive, one construct Stalagg randomly surges increasing attack speed by 100% and damage by 25% (on 25 man just 200% attack speed) briefly, and Feugen pulses an AoE nature damage to all players in 60 yards every 3 seconds. If they are pulled too far away from their respective coils (located behind them), the tesla coil will activate, doing unhealable nature damage to the group and causing a wipe. Every 30 seconds the tanks will be thrown across to the opposite platform, their threat will also switch. These must die within 5 seconds of each other or they will respawn with full health. In phase 2 you jump from the platform to the boss area (mind the jump, you can miss, doing so means you need to run to the start and try again). Shortly after that the boss will activate and Thaddius will begin, start the fight grouped up and split on the core mechanic - Polarity Shift, this will charge the entire raid and apply a debuff, Negative or Positive charge. If these are within 10 yards of each other they will do damage to each other. If you are within range of similarly charged people you will gain a stacking (5 on 10 man 13 on 25 man) 10% increased damage done. Normally the raid will discuss which side of the boss each charge is stacking on, when the boss recasts Polarity shift be sure to rotate in the agreed upon direction (normally clockwise) around the boss to avoid stacking with others that may be oppositely charged. Do not combat res on this fight as you will likely insta kill them again, as they will not have a charge and will be hit by both charges. Aside from that Thaddius does a chain lightning mechanic that hits people but will likely be healed through and a random ball lightning that will likely one shot if noone is in melee range of the boss. He also has a 6 minute enrage that will likely cause a wipe.",

                    "overview": "Sapphiron is one of the two final fights in Naxxramas and unlockable once you've killed all other bosses (until later in the patch when you can skip straight there). Sapphiron is a two-phase fight, Ground phase and Air phase, there is an argument to using frost resistance auras + gear here especially early in the tier as the damage from frost aura is quite extreme. Ground phase consists of a frontal cleave, a tail swipe, a mage-like blizzard effect slowing players and doing considerable frost damage and a frost aura that ticks every two seconds. He also has a curse that is applied randomly to 2 players (5 on 25 man) that deals damage and heals Sapphiron and should quickly be decursed. Sapphiron also takes considerable less damage from frost attacks. Ground phase is best dealt with by having the tank pickup the boss in the middle and face the boss side on to the raid, the rest of the raid spread around the room, avoiding being too close to people with healers spread around to cover everyone. As long as the boss has more than 10% health he will go into the Air phase every 45 seconds. During Air Phase Sapphiron will fire ice bolts at 2 (3 on 25 man) players randomly and freeze them, this creates an object that can be line of sighted behind, 7 seconds after the last ice bolt Sapphiron will do a frost breath hitting everyone in line of sight for extreme frost damage likely resulting in a death. The idea here is everyone stacks behind the ice bolts and line of sights the breath. Once landing, the Ground phase will continue.",

Phase one consists of an add management phase, there will be 3 different types of adds that spawn and run towards the centre, where the raid will be stacked. Soul Weavers - Slow moving adds that will cast a knockback and damage on people in melee range. Unstoppable Abominations - Constructs that should be picked up by the tanks, they don't hit too hard but can apply a stacking 10% healing reduction effect. Soldiers of the Frozen Wastes - These will explode upon getting into melee range with any player, killing the skeleton and dealing damage to any player in range. There are adds spawned in the enclaves around the room, these are where the adds move from, you do not have to kill all of these adds. Staying in the centre and killing anything that approaches is the safest way. Phase two is when Kel’thuzad himself joins the fight, he casts two types of frostbolt, a partially resistable single target frostbolt on the tank and a fully resistible volley on the raid, Frost resistance can be massive for reducing this damage. Kel’thuzad will also spawn fissures on the floor under a random player, after 3 seconds they explode instantly killing any player in it. Kel’thuzad will also cast ‘Detonate Mana’ on a random player, after 5 seconds dealing AoE damage based on maximum mana to all players hit. The core mechanic on this fight and likely the thing that will wipe raids is Frost Blast, Kel’thuzad picks a random target and freeze them and all allies within 10 yards within an ice block. Whilst frozen the targets take 26% max health damage per second, totaling 104% maximum damage over the freeze, they will need to be focus healed asap. On 25 man only Kel’thuzad also mind controls 3 targets randomly, these players will increase their damage and size by 200% and attempt to buff and heal (At 500% efficiency) kel’thuzad. These should be CC’d asap. At 45% phase 3 begins, the boss continues all of phase 2 abilities however now 2 adds (4 on 25 man) will spawn from portals in the enclaves in the room, these do a blood tap dealing damage and infinitely stacking a 15% damage increase, these should be picked up by the tank and moved away from the group, but does cause a slight soft enrage to the fight.",

All Drakes - Shadow Fissure - spawns a fissure under a random player's feet that explodes after 5 seconds dealing shadow damage (higher on 25 man). Shadow Breath - a frontal cone shadow breath dealing damage to all players in front of him. Vesperon - Twilight Torment - Every 30 seconds this boss will open a portal whilst simultaneously placing a shield on himself that deals shadow damage to attackers. In order to remove this shield players must kill the portal boss - the Acolyte of Vesperon. Acolyte of Vesperon - simple mob that deals minimal damage (although should be tanked) and increases fire and shadow damage taken whilst alive and reflects shadow damage. Shadron - Summon Acolyte - Similar to Vesperon, Shadron summons a portal and an acolyte the difference here however, is whilst this acolyte is alive Shadron deals increased fire damage and takes no damage. Acolyte of Shadron - deals low damage only to the highest threat target (should still be tanked). Tenebron -  Hatch Eggs - Every 30 seconds, Tenebron will spawn a portal and 6 eggs inside, after 20 seconds they will hatch into whelps, These will eventually come out of the portal if noone is in there. Sartharion - Cleave - Hits the primary target and up to 9 other targets around the primary target dealing physical damage. Flame Breath - deals fire damage to all targets in a frontal cone, deals increased damage on 25 man. Lava Wall - One of the key mechanics of this fight, walls will spawn in one of two layouts, left or right. Fire Adds - These are adds with high health pools but relatively low damage that spawn in groups of 2-4 throughout the fight, these should be picked up by the OT. If hit by the flame wall, they enrage doing 500% damage and increasing in size.",

Tenebron will join the fight at the 30 second marker, Increases shadow damage taken by all of the raid by 100% whilst Tenebron is still alive and upon death grants Sartharion a stack of Twilight Revenge increasing damage and attack speed by 25%. Tenebron will continue to spawn adds in the portal realm that will hatch and eventually join the fight. Shadron will join the fight at 75 seconds, increasing all fire damage taken by 100% until dead, and upon death granting Sartharion a stack of Twilight Revenge increasing damage and attack speed by 25%. Shadron will still retain his ability to put a shield on himself making him immune to damage and spawning a portal with his Acolyte in. Killing Shadron before this immunity is recommended. Vesperon is the final drake to join at 125 seconds into the fight, decreasing the raid's maximum health by 25% until defeated, and granting Sartharion a stack of Twilight Revenge increasing damage by 25% upon death. Vesperon retains the ability to spawn a portal and gain a damage-reflecting shield during the fight; this can either be burnt through or dealt with correctly by killing the Acolyte. Ideally Vesperon should die before the shield occurs. Important to note, if you get Sartharion down to 35% whilst a drake still lives, the boss enrages dealing 500% increased damage and 150% increased attack speed.",

Secondly the boss spawns sparks that will appear around the room, these will slowly move towards the boss, if they reach the boss they will buff his damage by 50%, this is a stacking effect. If players kill the sparks they will drop a pulsing AoE circle that increases the damage of all players inside it by 50% for the duration. Finally the boss will periodically fly into the air and summon a vortex to lift players in the air, dealing large amounts of arcane damage and fall damage at the end. Only instant cast spells can be used during this without CDs being used.Phase 2 starts at 50%, Malygos will fly into the air for about 10 seconds, during this time ranged players can deal maximum damage before the boss flies away. Nexus Lords and Scions of Eternity will spawn on discs, once killed they drop their disc and players can mount it, flying up into the air. Malygos will occasionally cast an Arcane Pulse dealing large arcane damage to all players within 30 yards, this can be mitigated by protective bubbles that spawn on the platform. They spawn at full size and periodically decrease. This effect can be out ranged by the players flying on discs if they fly up. Malygos will also hit random players with Arcane Storm, dealing moderate arcane damage.Once all Nexus Lords and Scions of Eternity are dead, Phase 3 will begin. Phase 3 is a mounted combat phase that will last until Malygos dies. Players will be dropped onto dragons that have the following abilities. Flame Spike - Deals moderate damage and applies 1 combo point. Engulf in Flames - Deals fire damage, this effect can stack and lasts for 3 seconds. Revivify - Heals the target for 500 damage every second for 10 seconds, stacks up to 5 times and applies “friendly” combo points on the player it was used on. Life Burst - Instantly heals all players within 60 yards and increases healing done by 50% for a duration based on the “friendly” combo points used. Flame Shield - Summons a shield to protect the caster from damage by 80%, lasts from 2-6 seconds based on combo points used. Blazing Speed - Increases the speed of the dragon by 500% for 8 seconds. Malygos will do two spells during this phase. Static Field, summoned on a random player dealing damage to all players within 30 yards every second. Surge of Power, targets multiple players with a beam of damage dealing damage every second for 5 seconds.",
